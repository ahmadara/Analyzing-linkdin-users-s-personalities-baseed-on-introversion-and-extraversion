The direct reduction unit of this company a module with a production capacity of 1 . 5 million of per year , where the produced is to the electric arc furnace in hot and cold form . The ratio of hot charge to cold charge is 1 : 3 Continuously charging hot ( 600 ° C ) can reduce the energy by as much as 16 % to 20 %. To be more precise ; hot charging the power requirement by 20kWh to 30kWh / 100oC . In addition , the tap - to - tap time in the electric arc furnace in the hot charging method is less than the cold charging method ( from 75 to 50 ). Another difference between hot charging and cold charging is the lower amount of carbon in the hot charging method , which is due to the lack of a cooling compressor in hot charging . Cold and hot are to the furnace at the same time according to the figure and the steelmaking operation .

A two - way fluid - solid Interaction ( ) algorithm is employed to simulate the performance of the human left ventricle during systole . The initial geometry of the left ventricle is extracted from scan of a healthy person . The simulation produced the systolic anterior motion of the Left Ventricle ( ) identical with the scan at later times during systole . Besides , the numerical for left ventricular volume change , maximum blood velocity at the aortic valve , and its maximum opening are in good agreement with physiological data . As an application of the above algorithm , a model of Hypertrophic ( ) or septal wall thickening disease is and studied during systole . This simulation an understanding of heart performance under . According to the simulation , the mitral valve the septal wall under due to the change in pressure gradient and the drag force on the mitral valve . This blockage of the blood passage by the mitral valve in stagnation pressure loss and hearth power . Therefore , the maximum opening of the aortic valve , in this case , is much lower than the physiological range , the drastic effect of on the performance of the aortic valve and systolic performance . # # # biomechanics # left_ventricle # hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy : comment = Great job man , the best is yet to come 👌🏻👌🏻👏👏 ۷ ! ۷ ، # ، \\u200c . ، :) ، \\u200c \\u200c . ، \\u200c . \\u200c \\u200c # # \\u200c .\\u200c ، \\u200c . 🙏 # excited to announce that our entire Deep Learning in Scientific Master \\' s course is now on ! 📖 Course learning : ✅ Be aware of advanced of deep learning in scientific ✅ Be familiar with the design , implementation and theory of these ✅ Understand the / of deep learning ✅ Understand key scientific machine learning and Prof . and I will talk you through a wide variety of scientific machine learning and , physics - informed neural , neural , neural differential , differentiable physics and their in fluid dynamics , geophysics , engineering and more . # # # # # can Learn a GREAT LESSON from here ...

Law school about 3 % of what you can do with your law degree . I often tell the story of going to my career office as a 1L and what else I can do with my expensive law degree other than practice , and their response was giving me a book something like , “ 1001 You Can Do With Your Law Degree ” in 1989 . That # aside , a is very malleable ! A law degree is a problem degree , a thinking degree , and a foundation in analysis and logic . So although law focus on like , law firm job , and public interest , the are far . More law now know about in - house work as a path forward . The in - house world is varied and many unique to partner with the business and problem solve more creatively and broadly than you might find in private practice . But lead in all . They run financial , they are management , they start , operate sports , produce Broadway , write , become happiness , run talent , lead , build 3D , manage hotel , start non - , seed early - stage , start tequila , operate beauty , pioneer accountability , and SO MUCH MORE . Stop thinking that all do is practice law , and don ’ t worry about what your law school , , or family may think of any non - traditional path you take within your career . After all , there are 1001 you can do with your law degree ! ! ، ، ، ، ... ، ، ، \" . .... ، ، . . .\" ، . ! . . ، Lawyer ( ) ، ؟ ، . ، ، . ... ، . .... .... . 2 ، . ، \\u200c ، \\u200c . # \\u200c ، # \\u200c . \\u200c .

In a few , the memory usage of fine - tuning without any performance to standard 16 - bit model fine - tuning . This method 33B model fine - tuning on a single 24GB and 65B model fine - tuning on a single 46GB . This is incredible ! More specifically , 4 - bit quantization to compress a language model . The are then frozen , and a relatively small number of trainable are added to the model in the form of Low - Rank . During , through the frozen 4 - bit language model into the Low - Rank . The LoRA are the only being during training . Read more about LoRA in the original LoRA paper ( :// . in / ). one storage data type ( usually 4 - bit ) for the base model and a computation data type ( 16 - bit ) used to perform . from the storage data type to the computation data type to perform the forward and backward , but only weight for the LoRA , which use 16 - bit . The are only when they are , therefore the memory usage stays low during training and inference . Beautiful ! tuning is shown to match 16 - bit in a wide range of . In addition , the Guanaco , which use for LLaMA on the ( OASST1 ), are state - of - the - art and are close to on the Vicuna . This is an additional demonstration of the power of tuning . Their Guanaco are reaching 99 . 3 % of the performance level of while only 24 of fine - tuning on a single . You can actually do it in . 📚 Links - Paper - :// . in / d2eXt9R3 for inference - :// . in / d - AES5yt for fine - tuning - :// . in / d_qwCjy9 Repository - :// . in / db4sw79m Use it with - :// . in / am to announce that our paper titled \" A Comparative Study on the Behavior of High - Rise Residential with and without Post - Transfer Plate System \" recently been in the Journal of and Concrete . Had an insightful conversation with about AI and catastrophic . Two we want to share : ( i ) It \\' s important that AI reach consensus on - similar to climate , who have rough consensus on climate change - to shape good policy . ( ) Do AI understand the world ? We think they do . If we list out and develop a view on key technical like this , it will help move us toward consensus on . I learned a lot speaking with . Let ’ s all of us in AI keep to learn from each other ! . Hi everyone , I usually don \\' t post anything personal on but one of the at work I am always trying to improve and grow into is the ability and courage to ask for help . Because at the end of the day , where ever we work , we \\' re all just people , and you can * never * know what someone might be going through . So every day , in whatever I do , I try to show up with kindness to myself and to . I to share with everyone that my dad was with cancer this year , and we \\' re at a point where we need help . If you can take a look , read the story , give something or share within your network , it would be a tremendous gift to me . If we \\' ever worked together or met briefly or we \\' been able to share a meal , this small kindness would go a long ways to helping me and my family . Thank you 🌱 ، 100 . . . # ali_nazarizadeh # # ai # # might be the next big step in AI . Here \\' s why recently said \" is the next frontier of prompt engineering \" is the equivalent of giving - based a memory and a body . You can now give a task to an AI agent and have it autonomously come up with a plan , execute on it , browse the web , and use new data to revise the strategy until the task is . It can analyze the market and come up with a trading strategy , customer service , marketing , finance , or other that continuous . There are three to it : 1 . Architecture : It - 4 and - 3 . 5 via . 2 . Autonomous : can refine its by self - critical review , building on its previous work and prompt history for more accurate . 3 . Memory Management : Integration with @ for long - term memory storage , context preservation and decision - making . 4 . - functionality : include file manipulation , web browsing , and data retrieval , distinguishing from previous AI by its application scope . During this , at 🤗 Hugging Face we \\' re to keep open - powerful AI instead of holding them behind closed / , leaving them in the of a few . This also the additional benefit that your data \\' t sent to another party as you maintain full access to the model . Today we \\' re excited to introduce Pix2Struct , a Transformer model from AI which is a very powerful document AI model . It can take in an image of a document , chart , or diagram and answer related to it , it can caption , ... all end - to - end ! There \\' s no engine involved whatsoever . 🤯 Pix2Struct is very similar to 🍩 in of architecture but it by 9 in of score on the .

Absorption of light : When a photocatalyst is exposed to light , the in the light are absorbed by the photocatalyst , which the in its molecular structure to become excited . 2 . Generation of electron - hole : The excited in the photocatalyst move to a higher energy level and leave a \" hole \" behind . This a pair of , known as an electron - hole pair . 3 . Redox : The electron - hole pair can then participate in redox ( reduction - oxidation ) with other in the surrounding environment . For example , in the presence of water and oxygen , the can react with water to produce hydrogen gas , while the can react with oxygen to produce hydroxyl . 4 . Regeneration of photocatalyst : After the electron - hole pair in a redox reaction , the photocatalyst must be to continue the photocatalytic process .

A flare system is an important safety feature in many industrial that handle flammable , , or . It is designed to safely dispose of excess or emergency hydrocarbon by burning them off into the atmosphere . The main of a flare system include : 1 . Flare Stack : A tall vertical pipe or tower that the hydrocarbon to be burned off at a safe distance from the ground . 2 . Flare Tip : The device at the top of the flare stack that and the hydrocarbon , converting them into water vapor and carbon dioxide . 3 . Ignition System : A mechanism that a reliable source of ignition for the flare tip . 4 . Flare Gas Header : A pipeline that the hydrocarbon from various and them to the flare stack . 5 . Knockout Drum : A vessel that any liquid or solid from the flare gas stream before it the flare stack , to prevent damage to the flare tip . 6 . Flare Gas Recovery System : A system that and any usable from the flare gas stream , reducing and improving efficiency . 7 . Flame Arrestor : A safety device that from back into the flare header and other equipment . 8 . Control System : A system that and the flow of hydrocarbon to the flare system , safe and efficient operation . 9 .

The near - surface micro - texture evolution induced by frictional force been in detail - . According to the , alloy better performance to Ti – 6Al – 4V in all the applied . The of oxidation and adhesion wear were clearly on all the worn of the worn . Low wear weight loss of alloy at lower applied is due to the continuous substructure development as well as the formation of - fiber alignment texture along the sliding direction in absence of texture in the highly refined . The that the transition from - fiber texture to cube texture place with the increase of applied load to 50N and leading to brittle fracture and third body abrasive wear particle generation . These phenomena have a high influence on the wear rate of alloy when the applied load .

I can post on sitting on my warm couch but I can ’ t be in and fight along with those and men . I am not brave . I woke up and picked up my phone like every morning . Here goes , from people , in solidarity with the ongoing in . Nothing is out of the ordinary and suddenly I come across a video , one out of three is thrown mercilessly on the pavement by the police , other two try to protect her and take her away . All the men in the video are doing nothing against this cruelty by the police . This hit me hard . I ’ t hold my . I am like , what the f ** k . These are being just because they want to have some humane freedom . As men what are we doing ? What am I doing ? Just being a spectator and posting on . A protest that is so comfortable . I made a decision , I will sacrifice my hair . Would it help ? I don ’ t know but I also want to feel a little discomfort . I want to feel that I am with those . hair is my right but I prevent myself from this right . I love my hair and I don ’ t like my face without hair on my head . My will be more distraught seeing my head like this . Maybe this could make me feel a tiny part of the discomfort of face today because of the inhumane put in place by political and religious of society and . I hope that this action of me would make me braver than today so that I could do more to help reduce the going on in this world . People will ask me , why have I cut my hair . This would give me a chance to talk about the situation in and then in general the situation of in the world . I believe that a conversation is necessary to be able to make people actively think about an issue . Every one of us is living comfortably in our own bubble . Comfort ’ t bring the change discomfort does . Cutting my hair is just a small step to bring myself a little discomfort . I can ’ t change the world but I can change myself and I truly believe in the statement “ Be the change you want to see in the world ”. If each of us just care of ourselves the world will change and become a better place to live . It is my opinion that men should take more responsibility when it comes to \\' s . We need to show and assure that they are not alone in this and we are together with them . This is necessary . The like “ We allow our …” must not exist in this world .

Ground Movement / Settlement : is typically in soil or soft ground . If the ground movement or settlement after the installation , it can cause the pipe to shift or crack , resulting in . 3 . Misalignment : If the machine or unexpected ground , it may deviate from the path , causing misalignment of the pipe . can lead to leakage along the or . 4 . External : External such as third - party excavation , construction in the vicinity , or natural like can cause damage to the pipe , resulting in . 5 . or Sealant Failure : often the use of or sealant to stabilize the surrounding soil and prevent water ingress . If the or sealant to properly seal the annular space between the pipe and the ground , may occur . 6 . Hydrostatic Pressure : In with high or water table , hydrostatic pressure can exert significant force on the pipe . If the pipe is not designed to withstand such pressure , it can lead to . In the event of a leak , it is crucial to identify and address the cause promptly . Leak detection such as pressure testing , acoustic , or visual may be employed to locate the exact leak point . Once , appropriate repair or remediation can be taken , which may include pipe , joint , or pipe replacement , depending on the extent of the damage . # two ago , Askari did not have much of a social media presence .

[ Protect from Damage ] How do we protect against Electrical Over - Stress ? When providing a sensitive amplifier input terminal to the outside world , we wonder what someone might connect or how it might be . Will it be with care … or could they carelessly plug it into the mains ? We all would like to make our equipment robust , able to sustain the most brutal treatment . How to protect against Electrical Over - Stress ( )? You can greatly improve tolerance to higher fault and increase the level of protection by external . Common signal such as the ubiquitous 1N4148 typically have a significantly lower forward voltage than the internal clamp . Connected in parallel with the internal , the majority of fault current will flow in the external diode . have an even lower forward voltage and may provide protection . The disadvantage — they tend to be very leaky . Reverse leakage current are generally a or more and that ’ s at room temperature . Leakage with temperature . Beware … you need a solid power supply voltage . Clamp , whether internal or external , rely on a relatively steady power supply voltage to limit the stress . If the fault pulse can dump enough current into the power supply rail , raising ( or lowering , on V -) the power supply , it can over - stress the supply voltage terminal . A typical positive linear regulator cannot sink current and can ’ t be upon to hold a steady voltage . supply bypass can help absorb a large pulse of fault current . Sustained fault current may require a clamp on the power supply . Use a just above the maximum power supply voltage so that it only during a fault . Note that on ± you would need equivalent protection on the negative side .

When the first monkey goes for the , the researcher all five with freezing water for five . Sometime later , when a second monkey inevitably to go for the , the researcher once again all five with the cold water for five . The researcher then the hose away and never it again . But , when a third monkey to go for the , the other four attack him to prevent him from climbing that ladder . They are afraid of the punishment that may come . Then , the researcher one of the with a new monkey who ’ t part of the original experiment and was never with water . And as soon as he the ladder to go for the , the other four attack him to keep him from doing so . If he again , they attack him again . Thus , the new monkey not to go after the because he ’ get if he does . The researcher a second monkey with another new monkey . When this monkey goes for the , the other four attack him , the new monkey never with water . The researcher then to replace all the one at a time until all five original are removed from the cage . Each time the newcomer goes for the , the attack , even when they , as new , have never received punishment for going after the . And thus , the new , who have never been with cold water , learn not to go after the temptation of the . The hypothesize that if they ask the why they don ’ t go for the , they ’ d answer , “ because that ’ s the way it ’ s always been done .” That ’ s what we call the Five Monkey Experiment “ Syndrome .” oiler Up , Indy ! 🚂 President Mung , along with Board of Chair Mike and University President Whitten and Board of Chair , today officially University in .

Check it out on ( )\\' s page : :// . in / # # ’ m going to dive into an exciting topic zero - knowledge in - based cryptography . Zero - knowledge are cryptographic that enable us to prove the truth of a statement without revealing any additional information , and - based cryptography mathematical that allow us to perform on elliptic curve . Imagine you have a secret and someone to verify that you know this secret without you actually it . Zero - knowledge in - based cryptography provide a solution to this challenge . In - based cryptography , we use elliptic , which are mathematical , to perform on . These are used to construct zero - knowledge . Here \\' s a simplified analogy to help us understand the idea : Let \\' s say we have a magical door that can only be if we have two specific : a golden key and a silver key . However , we want to prove that we know the combination of these two without revealing the actual themselves . This is where - based zero - knowledge come in . 1 . Setup : We agree on the cryptographic and generate the necessary and elliptic . 2 . Interaction : You , as the verifier , possess the magical door and the golden key . I , as the prover , claim that I know the combination of the golden key and the silver key to open the door . However , I don \\' t want to reveal the actual . 3 . Proof : the operation , we can perform a series of that involve combining the golden key , the silver key , and other . These produce a proof that that I possess the knowledge of the combination without revealing the actual themselves . 4 . Verification : As the verifier , you can take the proof by me and use the operation to verify its validity . By the the given elliptic and public information , you can determine if the proof is valid without gaining any knowledge of the secret . The power of - based zero - knowledge in their ability to convince of a statement \\' s truth without revealing any sensitive information . By the operation on elliptic , we can perform that enable efficient and secure zero - knowledge . - based zero - knowledge have practical in like secure authentication , anonymous credential , and privacy - . They allow us to demonstrate knowledge of a statement without any private data , privacy and security in various digital . # security # cryptography # data # digital # mathematics # privacy # # - funded studentship ( Home or International ) with full stipend - on 3D Printing and , and in collaboration with .

We Expect the Fed to Cut Interest in 2023 We expect the Fed to pivot to easing monetary policy in 2023 as inflation back to the central bank \\' s 2 % target and the need to shore up economic growth becomes paramount . We project the federal - funds rate to fall from a peak 3 % at the start of 2023 to 1 . 5 % by 2024 . Accordingly , longer - term – mortgage – should fall as well . Falling inflation should clear the way for the Fed to cut interest . We \\' re projecting price to swing from inflationary to deflationary by 2023 , owing greatly to the unwinding of price by supply in , energy , and other . As such , we project inflation to average just 1 . 5 % over 2023 through 2026 . Once the war on inflation is won , the Fed could shift to doing what ’ s to jump - start economic growth . We ’ re projecting that real gross domestic product growth remains in positive territory on a full - year basis . But growth will be uncomfortably low in the near term ( we project 1 . 3 % in 2023 ), and that the Fed to easing . # economic # # 🚀 . . @ . net . @ . !!! 1 . : \" . \" \" The central limit theorem that the sampling distribution of the mean will always be normally distributed , as long as the sample size is large enough .\" 2 - - . . 3 - \\u200c . # مهندسی_صنایع # # مهندسی_مالی # # # Python Introductory Certificate .

I ’ m happy to share that I ’ m starting a new position as Product Manager at ! Every organization needs to innovate . But what type of innovation to give priority to ? This simple matrix with four of innovation may help . Innovation basically something new (‘ nova ’). This “ something new ” can be anything and that ’ s where the problem . In two ways . - First , by an overemphasis on product ( or service ) innovation , thereby not giving enough attention to other - Second , by getting by all the innovation that are out there . To solve both at the same time , it to gain some clarity on what of innovation there are . To that end , I ’ this simple 2x2 matrix what I think are the four most important of innovation for every organization . Let me first explain the two axes . The first is the inward - outward axis . Outward - are those that are mostly targeted at the market , at doing something new for . Inward - , on the other hand , are the organization itself . On the second axis , Operational are typically quite technical and tangible , and on the practical work and output . Strategic , on the other hand , regard how the organization is overall and how it value . This to the following four of innovation : 1 . Product Innovation . The most well - known type of innovation in which you change , improve or renew an organization ’ s and / or , or create new . 2 . Process Innovation . Often efficiency and quality - driven to improve the way the organization works on a day - to - day basis . This can concern any type of process . 3 . Business Model Innovation . A type , on how the organization and value . Often on new revenue . 4 . Management Innovation . Less commonly known but critical , this type how an organization is organized , , and led . Often decentralization . All four are important and with this matrix you can start your innovation portfolio . Ask yourself like : Do I have sufficient in all ? And , which type of innovation should get priority now ? # # # # ’ m happy to share that I ’ m starting a new position as Human Specialist at !

The performance of the algorithm was experimentally on an 8 × 8 array that ( - 0162 ). The experimental that the application of the tapering profile enhanced the capacity of digital ( ) with a single set of to linearize the array over a wide steering range . Specifically , when the elevation angle is between − 50 ◦ and 50 ◦, the in the adjacent channel power ratio ( ) and error vector magnitude ( ) after are ≤ 0 . 5 and ≤ 0 . 3 for the designed taper with 6 and 4 , respectively , for a uniform taper . # # # # # : comment = Glad to see your hard work pay off !

A brief article on \" Methane as a future rocket fuel \": Methane was only considered potential future fuel until ( Raptor engine , 2 . 2 - newton ) and BLUE ORIGIN ( BE - 4 engine , 2 . 4 - newton ) for commercial flight . The cost of fuel is approximately 0 . 3 % of the cost of flying rocket to the orbit . So , the fuel cost is not an important factor . But if we plan to colonize the , refueling and application of Methane as the first fuel might solve other major energy problem in the exploration .

The direct reduction unit of this company a module with a production capacity of 1 . 5 million of per year , where the produced is to the electric arc furnace in hot and cold form . The ratio of hot charge to cold charge is 1 : 3 Continuously charging hot ( 600 ° C ) can reduce the energy by as much as 16 % to 20 %. To be more precise ; hot charging the power requirement by 20kWh to 30kWh / 100oC . In addition , the tap - to - tap time in the electric arc furnace in the hot charging method is less than the cold charging method ( from 75 to 50 ). Another difference between hot charging and cold charging is the lower amount of carbon in the hot charging method , which is due to the lack of a cooling compressor in hot charging . Cold and hot are to the furnace at the same time according to the figure and the steelmaking operation .

A two - way fluid - solid Interaction ( ) algorithm is employed to simulate the performance of the human left ventricle during systole . The initial geometry of the left ventricle is extracted from scan of a healthy person . The simulation produced the systolic anterior motion of the Left Ventricle ( ) identical with the scan at later times during systole . Besides , the numerical for left ventricular volume change , maximum blood velocity at the aortic valve , and its maximum opening are in good agreement with physiological data . As an application of the above algorithm , a model of Hypertrophic ( ) or septal wall thickening disease is and studied during systole . This simulation an understanding of heart performance under . According to the simulation , the mitral valve the septal wall under due to the change in pressure gradient and the drag force on the mitral valve . This blockage of the blood passage by the mitral valve in stagnation pressure loss and hearth power . Therefore , the maximum opening of the aortic valve , in this case , is much lower than the physiological range , the drastic effect of on the performance of the aortic valve and systolic performance . # # # biomechanics # left_ventricle # hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy : comment = Great job man , the best is yet to come 👌🏻👌🏻👏👏 ۷ ! ۷ ، # ، \\u200c . ، :) ، \\u200c \\u200c . ، \\u200c . \\u200c \\u200c # # \\u200c .\\u200c ، \\u200c . 🙏 # excited to announce that our entire Deep Learning in Scientific Master \\' s course is now on ! 📖 Course learning : ✅ Be aware of advanced of deep learning in scientific ✅ Be familiar with the design , implementation and theory of these ✅ Understand the / of deep learning ✅ Understand key scientific machine learning and Prof . and I will talk you through a wide variety of scientific machine learning and , physics - informed neural , neural , neural differential , differentiable physics and their in fluid dynamics , geophysics , engineering and more . # # # # # can Learn a GREAT LESSON from here ...

In a few , the memory usage of fine - tuning without any performance to standard 16 - bit model fine - tuning . This method 33B model fine - tuning on a single 24GB and 65B model fine - tuning on a single 46GB . This is incredible ! More specifically , 4 - bit quantization to compress a language model . The are then frozen , and a relatively small number of trainable are added to the model in the form of Low - Rank . During , through the frozen 4 - bit language model into the Low - Rank . The LoRA are the only being during training . Read more about LoRA in the original LoRA paper ( :// . in / ). one storage data type ( usually 4 - bit ) for the base model and a computation data type ( 16 - bit ) used to perform . from the storage data type to the computation data type to perform the forward and backward , but only weight for the LoRA , which use 16 - bit . The are only when they are , therefore the memory usage stays low during training and inference . Beautiful ! tuning is shown to match 16 - bit in a wide range of . In addition , the Guanaco , which use for LLaMA on the ( OASST1 ), are state - of - the - art and are close to on the Vicuna . This is an additional demonstration of the power of tuning . Their Guanaco are reaching 99 . 3 % of the performance level of while only 24 of fine - tuning on a single .

Two we want to share : ( i ) It \\' s important that AI reach consensus on - similar to climate , who have rough consensus on climate change - to shape good policy . ( ) Do AI understand the world ? We think they do . If we list out and develop a view on key technical like this , it will help move us toward consensus on . I learned a lot speaking with . Let ’ s all of us in AI keep to learn from each other ! . I ’ m happy to share that I ’ a new certification : training from University of ! ، 100 . . . # ali_nazarizadeh # # ai # # might be the next big step in AI . Here \\' s why recently said \" is the next frontier of prompt engineering \" is the equivalent of giving - based a memory and a body . You can now give a task to an AI agent and have it autonomously come up with a plan , execute on it , browse the web , and use new data to revise the strategy until the task is . It can analyze the market and come up with a trading strategy , customer service , marketing , finance , or other that continuous . There are three to it : 1 . Architecture : It - 4 and - 3 . 5 via . 2 . Autonomous : can refine its by self - critical review , building on its previous work and prompt history for more accurate . 3 . Memory Management : Integration with @ for long - term memory storage , context preservation and decision - making . 4 . - functionality : include file manipulation , web browsing , and data retrieval , distinguishing from previous AI by its application scope . During this , at 🤗 Hugging Face we \\' re to keep open - powerful AI instead of holding them behind closed / , leaving them in the of a few . This also the additional benefit that your data \\' t sent to another party as you maintain full access to the model . Today we \\' re excited to introduce Pix2Struct , a Transformer model from AI which is a very powerful document AI model . It can take in an image of a document , chart , or diagram and answer related to it , it can caption , ... all end - to - end ! There \\' s no engine involved whatsoever . 🤯 Pix2Struct is very similar to 🍩 in of architecture but it by 9 in of score on the . This is thanks to its simple but scalable self - - training method , which of from masked of web page . No less than 20 are available on the hub !

In these ways coaching can support legal in setting professional : 1 . Providing a safe and confidential space : Coaching legal a chance to discuss their and in a confidential and non - space . This can be especially helpful for who may not feel comfortable their professional with or . 2 . and : An experienced coach can help legal identify their and , which can in turn inform their professional . For example , a lawyer who work - life balance might set a goal to take on or delegate more to . 3 . Breaking down long - term into actionable : Once legal have their long - term , a coach can help them break down those into smaller , actionable . By on these smaller , can make progress towards their and stay along the way . 4 . Providing accountability and support : Coaching a degree of accountability and support that can be difficult to find elsewhere .

This that many of the typical # administrative of # construction need to be expedited — in particular , review and approval of through “ .” In construction , there is often a much shorter time frame in which to review and before on site for installation in the first phase . 🔵---------------------------- The overall construction period to be slightly longer , and that , , cabinetry , , .— be on site multiple times during a project . In typical , non - construction , the contractor to limit the number of times a particular trade must be on site . In construction , trade need to return to the site & remobilize multiple times . 🔵---------------------------- Care for the is of the utmost importance during construction where partial occupancy is . For example , if hazardous are being and removed in each phase of construction , extreme care must be taken to protect from this activity . Similarly , construction logistics must be so as to minimally disrupt the daily of . This may include elevator use , parking , or the loading and of . 🔵---------------------------- Particularly in housing , where in different phases might receive the same general design , early construction phases often inform subsequent . This may be particularly true as the project team works together to develop to unexpected field that come to light early on . 🔵---------------------------- “ Punch listing ”— one of the major and of the architect during construction — must be multiple times . It typically a methodical survey of all or . Once the architect that all the marked on the punch list as needing attention have been or corrected , they can determine that the work is “ substantially complete .” In construction , this process is at the end of each phase . 🔵---------------------------- # project # # team # work # design # architect # logistics # housing # parking # # # # # Hey everyone , I recently gave a presentation on Connected Autonomous ( ) and found myself becoming more and more interested in the transportation industry as a whole .

For example , can be used to break down organic in water and air , converting them into less harmful . The photocatalytic process can be broken down into several : 1 . Absorption of light : When a photocatalyst is exposed to light , the in the light are absorbed by the photocatalyst , which the in its molecular structure to become excited . 2 . Generation of electron - hole : The excited in the photocatalyst move to a higher energy level and leave a \" hole \" behind . This a pair of , known as an electron - hole pair . 3 . Redox : The electron - hole pair can then participate in redox ( reduction - oxidation ) with other in the surrounding environment . For example , in the presence of water and oxygen , the can react with water to produce hydrogen gas , while the can react with oxygen to produce hydroxyl . 4 . Regeneration of photocatalyst : After the electron - hole pair in a redox reaction , the photocatalyst must be to continue the photocatalytic process . This can be done by another source of energy , such as heat or additional light . are important that have a wide range of in various .

My friend said , “ How does your cutting hair help in ? I don \\' t think these help anyone other than yourself .” He is right in his opinion . This is not going to help anyone . What could I have done otherwise ? I am not brave enough . I can post on sitting on my warm couch but I can ’ t be in and fight along with those and men . I am not brave . I woke up and picked up my phone like every morning . Here goes , from people , in solidarity with the ongoing in . Nothing is out of the ordinary and suddenly I come across a video , one out of three is thrown mercilessly on the pavement by the police , other two try to protect her and take her away . All the men in the video are doing nothing against this cruelty by the police . This hit me hard . I ’ t hold my . I am like , what the f ** k . These are being just because they want to have some humane freedom . As men what are we doing ? What am I doing ? Just being a spectator and posting on . A protest that is so comfortable . I made a decision , I will sacrifice my hair . Would it help ? I don ’ t know but I also want to feel a little discomfort . I want to feel that I am with those . hair is my right but I prevent myself from this right . I love my hair and I don ’ t like my face without hair on my head . My will be more distraught seeing my head like this . Maybe this could make me feel a tiny part of the discomfort of face today because of the inhumane put in place by political and religious of society and . I hope that this action of me would make me braver than today so that I could do more to help reduce the going on in this world . People will ask me , why have I cut my hair . This would give me a chance to talk about the situation in and then in general the situation of in the world . I believe that a conversation is necessary to be able to make people actively think about an issue . Every one of us is living comfortably in our own bubble . Comfort ’ t bring the change discomfort does . Cutting my hair is just a small step to bring myself a little discomfort . I can ’ t change the world but I can change myself and I truly believe in the statement “ Be the change you want to see in the world ”. If each of us just care of ourselves the world will change and become a better place to live . It is my opinion that men should take more responsibility when it comes to \\' s . We need to show and assure that they are not alone in this and we are together with them . This is necessary . The like “ We allow our …” must not exist in this world . A man ’ t be the master but the partner of a woman . and only should be to allow or disallow something to themselves . for a better world tomorrow . # # # : comment = This a lot ! I appreciate it .

The direct reduction unit of this company a module with a production capacity of 1 . 5 million of per year , where the produced is to the electric arc furnace in hot and cold form . The ratio of hot charge to cold charge is 1 : 3 Continuously charging hot ( 600 ° C ) can reduce the energy by as much as 16 % to 20 %. To be more precise ; hot charging the power requirement by 20kWh to 30kWh / 100oC . In addition , the tap - to - tap time in the electric arc furnace in the hot charging method is less than the cold charging method ( from 75 to 50 ). Another difference between hot charging and cold charging is the lower amount of carbon in the hot charging method , which is due to the lack of a cooling compressor in hot charging . Cold and hot are to the furnace at the same time according to the figure and the steelmaking operation .

You can it for free this link : :// . in / e7iFXF27 Any and suggestion would be greatly . This an accurate blood flow model with tissue deformation of the human left ventricle , the aortic valve . A two - way fluid - solid Interaction ( ) algorithm is employed to simulate the performance of the human left ventricle during systole . The initial geometry of the left ventricle is extracted from scan of a healthy person . The simulation produced the systolic anterior motion of the Left Ventricle ( ) identical with the scan at later times during systole . Besides , the numerical for left ventricular volume change , maximum blood velocity at the aortic valve , and its maximum opening are in good agreement with physiological data . As an application of the above algorithm , a model of Hypertrophic ( ) or septal wall thickening disease is and studied during systole . This simulation an understanding of heart performance under . According to the simulation , the mitral valve the septal wall under due to the change in pressure gradient and the drag force on the mitral valve . This blockage of the blood passage by the mitral valve in stagnation pressure loss and hearth power . Therefore , the maximum opening of the aortic valve , in this case , is much lower than the physiological range , the drastic effect of on the performance of the aortic valve and systolic performance . # # # biomechanics # left_ventricle # hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy : comment = Great job man , the best is yet to come 👌🏻👌🏻👏👏 up the excitement of # LeMans24 . from the iconic Place in # , our convoy is headed straight for the legendary circuit .

The of oxidation and adhesion wear were clearly on all the worn of the worn . Low wear weight loss of alloy at lower applied is due to the continuous substructure development as well as the formation of - fiber alignment texture along the sliding direction in absence of texture in the highly refined . The that the transition from - fiber texture to cube texture place with the increase of applied load to 50N and leading to brittle fracture and third body abrasive wear particle generation . These phenomena have a high influence on the wear rate of alloy when the applied load .

Every organization needs to innovate . But what type of innovation to give priority to ? This simple matrix with four of innovation may help . Innovation basically something new (‘ nova ’). This “ something new ” can be anything and that ’ s where the problem . In two ways . - First , by an overemphasis on product ( or service ) innovation , thereby not giving enough attention to other - Second , by getting by all the innovation that are out there . To solve both at the same time , it to gain some clarity on what of innovation there are . To that end , I ’ this simple 2x2 matrix what I think are the four most important of innovation for every organization . Let me first explain the two axes . The first is the inward - outward axis . Outward - are those that are mostly targeted at the market , at doing something new for . Inward - , on the other hand , are the organization itself . On the second axis , Operational are typically quite technical and tangible , and on the practical work and output . Strategic , on the other hand , regard how the organization is overall and how it value . This to the following four of innovation : 1 . Product Innovation . The most well - known type of innovation in which you change , improve or renew an organization ’ s and / or , or create new . 2 . Process Innovation . Often efficiency and quality - driven to improve the way the organization works on a day - to - day basis . This can concern any type of process . 3 . Business Model Innovation . A type , on how the organization and value . Often on new revenue . 4 . Management Innovation . Less commonly known but critical , this type how an organization is organized , , and led . Often decentralization . All four are important and with this matrix you can start your innovation portfolio . Ask yourself like : Do I have sufficient in all ? And , which type of innovation should get priority now ? # # # # ’ m happy to share that I ’ m starting a new position as Human Specialist at !

Why build an ornithopter ? Because the challenge of understanding and efficient flight is difficult and therefore an excellent test of engineering . Ornithopter must and support the weight of the aircraft while dynamically to perform efficiently . The wing design careful tuning and the drive mechanism must operate in resonance with the to create a nearly constant load at the drive motor . If any part of the system ’ t fall within the narrow range of “ goodness ” the ornithopter will fly poorly or may not fly at all . There are many ways to build an ornithopter and the best approach remains unknown , as no man - made ornithopter the overall performance of medium to large sized . For man - made aircraft it remains simpler , lighter , and more efficient to use a propeller than , but in nature been perfected . I built this model several ago and have tested a dozen wing with it . This video one of my better flying somewhat efficiently .

A shallow copy a new object , but the inside the new object still reference the same memory as the original object . In other , the new object is a separate entity , but it the underlying data with the original object . Therefore , if you modify a mutable element within the shallow copy , it will also affect the original object . On the other hand , a deep copy a completely independent copy of the original object , all of its . Each element of the new object is a separate entity with its own memory location . the within the deep copy does not affect the original object . Credit : 5 in the and at / !

So what \\' s so special about ? Well , it works just like a regular dictionary , but if you try to access a key that \\' t exist , it will create a new item with a default value that you specify . This can save you a lot of time and effort , especially when working with data . In this example , we create a with a default value of , which is 0 . We then add some to the dictionary the usual dictionary syntax . Notice that we don \\' t need to check if the exist before to them - if the key \\' t exist , it will be with the default value of 0 . The class is particularly useful when working with data , as it you to avoid writing code to check if a key before to it . Instead , you can simply access the key and it will be automatically if it \\' t exist . Pretty cool , right ?

This can be by various such as differential sticking , hole , swelling , or equipment failure . To deal with stuck , several can be used depending on the cause of the problem . Some of these include : Jarring : This a tool known as a jar to create a sudden impact that can help free the stuck pipe . Rotation : Rotating the pipe can help break any differential sticking or other and free the pipe . : special or can help reduce friction and loosen the pipe . Milling : Milling a specialized tool to grind through the pipe or other . Fishing : Fishing specialized to retrieve any lost equipment or debris from the . It \\' s essential to work with experienced who have the necessary equipment and to handle stuck pipe safely and effectively . Stuck pipe is a common problem in the oil and gas drilling process , and it can be by several , : Differential Sticking : This when the drill string becomes stuck to the side of the due to the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the drill pipe . The differential pressure the pipe to stick , making it difficult to remove . Hole : The may contain such as , key , or that can trap the drill string , leading to stuck pipe . Drilling : The of the drilling fluid , viscosity and density , can cause the drill pipe to stick . For example , a thick or heavy drilling mud can cause differential sticking or mud cake buildup on the wall of the . Formation Damage : Formation damage can occur when drilling through certain rock .

It you to pass an arbitrary number of to a method , which can be convenient in certain . However , whether or not the use of the code clean on how it is used . ✳ of in C #: - Concise and readable code : you to pass a variable number of without explicitly an array or each argument individually . This can make your code more compact and easier to read , especially when dealing with that accept multiple . - Flexibility and convenience : flexibility by to accept a different number of without needing to define multiple of the method . It the process of calling with argument , making the code more convenient to use . - Reduced code duplication : By , you can avoid multiple of a method with different parameter . This code duplication and maintenance easier , as you only need to modify a single method when making . ✳ and when : - Performance overhead : When , the to the method are wrapped into an array . This additional array creation and memory allocation can have a performance impact , especially when dealing with large argument . If performance is a critical concern , may not be the most optimal choice . - Reduced discoverability : When a method , it may be less discoverable to other , as the method signature alone does not indicate the number of .

In such , anode play a vital role and can easily affect the reaction pathway and its efficiency . So far , numerous electrode have been employed for this purpose , noble ( and mixed metal oxide ( )), boron - diamond ( ), and PbO2 . The primary key to an efficient OER electrode is the fabrication of an with low overpotential , high activity , low - cost , and excellent stability . Our that the tri - lead dioxide - fluorine - iron - cobalt ( PbO2 - F - Fe - ) remarkable , super - , high electrocatalytic activity , and exceptional durability .

And sometimes there ’ t . Strange , right ? 🤷\\u200d♂️ There ’ s actually a perfectly good explanation for it . We our colleague and food scientist to explain - this is the short version of his answer 😊👇 ➡️ Both yoghurt and cream cheese are by milk by lactic acid bacteria . During the acidification , a protein network is formed , which the product it ’ s texture and firmness . The protein network is also capable of binding a substantial amount of water , but sometimes it ’ t bind all of it . So , the liquid is actually just a bit of water . ➡️ and his have spent long how much water is bound in different of dairy and how to increase the amount of water that ’ s bound . This can be by the recipe or production process . For example , a bit of salt fine - the protein network to make more space for liquid to be bound in the product . ➡️ A different approach to improve the water binding is to add so - that can bind the liquid . Locust bean gum and are some of the most common , but there are many different . However , in many of our we have decided not to add , which that you may encounter a bit of liquid in our – for example in cream cheese , like the one is holding 😊 # Dairy # # Natural Does your know your ? # # # management # at Business Review provide an excellent starting framework to think about where value comes from .

It is by a significant increase in the amplitude of vibration when the frequency of the driving force the natural frequency of the system . Resonance when a vibrating system its amplitude due to the interaction with another vibrating system that the same oscillation frequency . This amplification because the energy transfer between the is at the resonant frequency . Resonance phenomena are essential in various , physics , engineering , and music , and understanding them is crucial for designing and that involve . To understand resonance technically , we need to consider a few key : Natural frequency : Every physical system a natural frequency at which it to vibrate when disturbed . This frequency on the system \\' s , such as its mass , stiffness , and geometry . It the frequency at which the system most easily and with the least amount of damping . Forced vibration : When a vibrating system is subjected to an external force that a frequency different from its natural frequency , it forced vibration . The system at the frequency of the external force , but the amplitude of vibration remains relatively low . Resonant frequency : Resonance when the frequency of the external force the natural frequency of the system . At this point , the system energy efficiently , resulting in a significant increase in the amplitude of vibration . The resonant frequency is the frequency at which resonance . Energy transfer : In resonance , energy is transferred back and forth between the two vibrating . When the external force is in phase with the system \\' s motion , energy is transferred from the driving system to the driven system , causing an amplification of the amplitude . This positive feedback loop until the energy in the system balance out the energy input . Damping : Damping to the dissipation of energy in a vibrating system . It can arise from various , such as friction , air resistance , or internal material . Damping the resonance behavior by reducing the amplitude of vibration and the resonance peak . # perfect hat ’ t exist Please For Credit 🙏 . ⚠️ No © Copyright infringement intended ❌( Contact ) Us to fix / Remove . # sleep # love # sleeping # sleepy # bed # cute # relax # health # # dog # # cat # baby # # night # rest # # wellness # happy # bedtime # tired # life # bedroom # # insomnia # mattress # # # home # dream # جبران_خدمات # مدل_جبران_خدمات # مدل_4P # # # منابع_انسانی # \\u200c \\u200c \\u200c 4P \\u200c : comment = ، ، : comment = \\u200c 😌 # # منابع_انسانی # محل_کار # : comment = . 😅 # منابع_انسانی # in 2023 ( 1402 🌱🌸) Glazing Station # # commissioner # ؛ \\u200c ، ، . ، \\u200c! ... ... ... ، . . ، ، . . # # # # # ؟ ، ؛ .

In our paper , we propose a novel semi - method , , that high - quality pseudo - parallel data for multilingual - training . We first - train a model on monolingual data to reorder , add , remove , and substitute , the quality of - training . Then , we generate different pseudo - for each - training document for word - by - word translation and the - trained model . This approach in high - quality pseudo - parallel data , which we use to - train our multilingual sequence - to - sequence model , PEACH . Our demonstrate that PEACH used in training mT5 and on various translation , , zero - and few - shot . Moreover , PEACH \\' s ability to transfer knowledge between similar it particularly useful for low - resource .

This simple framework create some clarity and make on what to measure and why . Every person and every organization . This measuring and a key aspect of business . Unfortunately , we ’ often seen it done wrong : too many , too few , too , irrelevant , unmeasurable , or otherwise ineffective ways of measuring used to manage . This is not surprising given the rich lexicon available to talk about : , , , , , , , , and so on , and so forth . To create some clarity ( also for myself …), I ’ what I think are the four main of result that you want to measure and manage , and have put them together in a simple framework showing their relationship . The four are : Effort - Based Measuring whether sufficient and the right have been used to achieve what is intended → Key question : have we correctly spent the and budget ? Activity - Based Measuring whether people have done the right at the right time to achieve what is intended → Key question : have we done what it to get the job done ? Output - Based : Measuring whether the right have been to achieve what is intended → Key question : did we generate the output we ? Outcome - Based : Measuring whether the right and intended effect and impact have been → Key question : did we achieve the effect that we ? All four can be used in parallel and none of them is better than the other . They simply serve different and are therefore used for different . Therefore , to effectively manage , you probably need a balanced set all four of measure . How do you manage and measure ? # # impact # is key to progress and success .

Such can be with by research to further enhance their ability to stimulate regeneration and interact with . How do get their colors ? Short answer : are made with various , each of which a characteristic color when it \\' s . Longer answer : It \\' s all about electron excitation . When are , jump from their ground state to a higher energy level , known as an excited state . Once in the excited state , the will eventually fall back down to their original energy level in the ground state . As the return to their ground state , they give off of light . The will have different and ( due to in number of and of for different ), resulting in different colors . Some of these colors are shown in the video ( courtesy of Amazing Physics on Twitter ), where are used to excite the . For example , you can see that : + Sodium Chloride ( ) with an orange - yellow flame . + Strontium Chloride ( SrCl2 ) with a red flame . + Copper Sulphate ( CuSO4 ) with a green flame .

This research the critical role of basal slip in the substructure development during friction stir of a magnesium alloy . In this respect , the lattice rotation axes are considered to identify the activity of different slip . The applied shear strain during the procedure is in the matrix through slip - induced at the grain level . The around distinct axes produce “ slip ” by necessary from the parent , significantly in grain refinement . The basal slip is easily in holding different energy ; however , the non - basal slip a higher dependency on the amount of local applied strain . the contribution of different slip in strain accommodation that the basal slip the highest fraction of low - angle into the microstructure leading to the development of the ultimate grain boundary structure . :// . in / eVhHCXE6 : , Abbas , , , , , # # Hot_deformation # # # Magnesium # Magnesium_alloy # Deformation # # Electron_backscatter_diffraction # # Grain # Grain_boundary # Grain_boundary_engineering # # Low_angle_grain_boundary # GOS # Grain_orientation_spread # # # # # Rotation # Crystal # # Research # # Researcher # # Friction_stir_processing # # Sever_plastic_deformation # ، \\u200c \\u200c : · ISO / DIN / · \\u200c · , Helix , · ۵ ۷ \\u200c @ . :// . in / eGBmKzq8 . # # مهندس_مکانیک # طراحی_سیستم_انتقال_مواد𝐒𝐮𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 , - - - The microstructural evolution and room - temperature mechanical of nitrogen - added Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10 as - cast high - entropy alloy were .

Oftentimes you hear about hard and smart work . The idea that smart work is more attractive than hard work is a common perception because it is often associated with efficiency , productivity , and quick , thus its quite easily visible from a distance . While the hard work is often associated with perseverance , dedication , discipline and long of sincere effort , that is not always visible or immediately . Also , the process can be . The analogy of the iceberg is often used to add perspective to illustrate the relationship between hard work and smart work . The visible part of the iceberg above the water the and that are immediately visible , such as , success , and recognition , better to the smart work . However , beneath the surface the , less visible part of the iceberg that the hard work , dedication , and effort to achieve those . Therefore , it is important that a simple copy and paste of a visible solution , worked previously or worked for someone else , may not solve your challenge . And , one of the proven approach towards an example or experience of a solution , is to pass it through the of space , time and context , to assess its relevance to use it now . Smart work does not necessarily mean cutting or sacrificing quality for speed and only with fine balance between the two , you can achieve the best while unnecessary and your potential . The to help you strike the right balance between the two would be to set SMART goal to your purpose , develop a strategy and schedule towards execution , work out a priority around urgent and important , be flexible in your approach , take and reflect , celebrate small success , seek support where from coach or mentor and learn from your to continually improve and grow . By balancing hard and smart work , you can achieve success seamlessly without compromising quality . The real mastery in life is making a complex challenge look and feel simpler . ----------------------------------- I am my purpose around \" keep it simple , work on , and live life by compass , to lead a meaningful life ”.

You can it for free this link : :// . in / e7iFXF27 Any and suggestion would be greatly . This an accurate blood flow model with tissue deformation of the human left ventricle , the aortic valve . A two - way fluid - solid Interaction ( ) algorithm is employed to simulate the performance of the human left ventricle during systole . The initial geometry of the left ventricle is extracted from scan of a healthy person . The simulation produced the systolic anterior motion of the Left Ventricle ( ) identical with the scan at later times during systole . Besides , the numerical for left ventricular volume change , maximum blood velocity at the aortic valve , and its maximum opening are in good agreement with physiological data . As an application of the above algorithm , a model of Hypertrophic ( ) or septal wall thickening disease is and studied during systole . This simulation an understanding of heart performance under . According to the simulation , the mitral valve the septal wall under due to the change in pressure gradient and the drag force on the mitral valve . This blockage of the blood passage by the mitral valve in stagnation pressure loss and hearth power . Therefore , the maximum opening of the aortic valve , in this case , is much lower than the physiological range , the drastic effect of on the performance of the aortic valve and systolic performance . # # # biomechanics # left_ventricle # hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy : comment = Great job man , the best is yet to come 👌🏻👌🏻👏👏 Flap disc The application of the shutter wheel is very wide , such as : ship , metal , glass .... the abrasive also different , alumina oxide , ceramic , zirconium . ، \\u200c \\u200c . : 30 17 19 : \\u200c \\u200c ، \\u200c ، \\u200c ، ، \\u200c .

And I usually do 👀 But today I will give you just 1 reason : Give people a good enough why should they care . 💞 Care about what you have to say 💞 Care about your business 💞 Care about your offer Take them on a journey with you . Tell them WHY you . Happy 🥳 Here ’ s my top 3 that I would advise to help you start your week of strong 💪🏼 1 , Plan your gym days , what days are you going to the gym ? Set them out at the start of the week and stick with them , try to avoid moving your gym sessions around last minute !! 2 , Decide what you \\' re training and Plan what you \\' re doing in your session before you get there ! ( It could be anything , , , upper , even a class !) 3 , Write down what you do in your sessions ! Take note of the you \\' used & the reps you \\' to hit . This is crucial for building the of a strong gym routine . If you want to be making progress you need to be consistent with your routine ! These may sound simple but they go a long way when you put them into practice . Give them a go and let me know how youve got on at the end of the week ! 👏🏻 And always remember , 3 days out of 7 is better than 0 days !! # gym # # fitness # * \\u200c ۱ . ۲ . \\u200c \\u200c ۱۰۰۰داره ، ۵۰۰۰۰هم ۵۰۰۰۰ش ! * Excessive consumption of some such as vitamin D is dangerous , so please 1 .

In the course of , a high amount of strain is applied under high strain and on the material , and hence , the activation of both deformation and restoration for strain accommodation is inevitable . Finally , we see a high length of and also surrounded by ( ), or sub - , in the microstructure of a severely deformed metallic material . It questionable how the substructure during the of and . Most research the recrystallization and recovery as the origin of grain boundary development during . On the contrary , numerous are the effect of grain subdivision on the increment of grain boundary fraction . Another idea is that we observe the of both strain accommodation ( i . e . deformation or restoration ) on the final microstructure . Surprisingly , the interpretation of active crystal rotation axes that after recrystallization of microstructure and formation of fresh during , substructure development is prominently continued by the activity of single - slip . Therefore , we primarily see the effect of slip activity on the formation of , regardless of previous competition between deformation and restoration for grain boundary structure .” I am delighted to share our new research “ The outstanding contribution of basal slip in substructure development during friction stir of magnesium ”. In this research , a history of substructure development was provided by grain classification based on the increment of inside during the strain accommodation .

The - strain of 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 were considered to investigate the effect of inter - pass time ( 5 - 300s ) on the compressive strength level . At the low strain level of 0 . 1 , the contribution of Hall - effect was considerable due to the occurrence of static recrystallization . In addition , the rare earth texture component was during inter - pass . This increasing the strength of the material during second pass of hot compression . In contrast , at higher strain , the strength level with increasing the inter - pass time of . The high amount of strain was completely and the energy was not high enough to trigger the occurrence of static recrystallization . The occurrence of recrystallization and subsequent growth were . In addition , the texture does not change in respect of the intensity or number / type of .

When come to me wanting to change their body composition , I direct them straight to the weight room . Contrary to the old “ to burn fat ” “ resistance training to build muscle ” dogma that fitness dished out for , resistance training is superior for burning fat – especially belly fat . I recommend that all strength train at least twice a week , regardless of age ! Young should incorporate lighter weight / higher repetition through a full range of motion and movement to help with body composition and biomechanical that occur with puberty . in their reproductive should look to power and hypertrophy training to improve body composition , bone density , and overall strength . in the menopause transition and beyond should strength - power training in their exercise routine , as hormonal make it harder to maintain muscle mass and strength ( and the hormone increase belly fat storage ). Strength training is looking to be the cornerstone and foundation across for body composition ’ re dressed and ready . You ’ re feeling pretty dang good . You think to yourself , “ This party is going to be so fun . There ’ s going to be so much amazing food there .” But that ’ t until later and your body to you thats she ’ s hungry now . Rather than ignore her and try to convince yourself that you need to “ save up ” your for later , you listen to her . You eat . THIS IS PROGRESS 🙌🏼💥💫 Remember , your fitness journey is more than just about the physical progress . Most importantly , it ’ s about how you feel and how you begin to treat , trust , and thank your body . For all she does and is able to do day in and day out . Nothing and I mean NOTHING is better than that . 🧡 # # # progress # # SHE 🙌🏼💥💫 The first week of Power & Strength 2 . 0 is officially out ! 🎉🎉🎉 It ’ s a continuation of the first program , but turned up a notch . You ’ notice exercise meant to burn those out . that will challenge you mentally in order for you to gain physically . It really is the next level for both the body and mind .

The performance of the algorithm was experimentally on an 8 × 8 array that ( - 0162 ). The experimental that the application of the tapering profile enhanced the capacity of digital ( ) with a single set of to linearize the array over a wide steering range . Specifically , when the elevation angle is between − 50 ◦ and 50 ◦, the in the adjacent channel power ratio ( ) and error vector magnitude ( ) after are ≤ 0 . 5 and ≤ 0 . 3 for the designed taper with 6 and 4 , respectively , for a uniform taper . # # # # # : comment = Glad to see your hard work pay off !

You can it for free this link : :// . in / e7iFXF27 Any and suggestion would be greatly . This an accurate blood flow model with tissue deformation of the human left ventricle , the aortic valve . A two - way fluid - solid Interaction ( ) algorithm is employed to simulate the performance of the human left ventricle during systole . The initial geometry of the left ventricle is extracted from scan of a healthy person . The simulation produced the systolic anterior motion of the Left Ventricle ( ) identical with the scan at later times during systole . Besides , the numerical for left ventricular volume change , maximum blood velocity at the aortic valve , and its maximum opening are in good agreement with physiological data . As an application of the above algorithm , a model of Hypertrophic ( ) or septal wall thickening disease is and studied during systole . This simulation an understanding of heart performance under . According to the simulation , the mitral valve the septal wall under due to the change in pressure gradient and the drag force on the mitral valve . This blockage of the blood passage by the mitral valve in stagnation pressure loss and hearth power . Therefore , the maximum opening of the aortic valve , in this case , is much lower than the physiological range , the drastic effect of on the performance of the aortic valve and systolic performance . # # # biomechanics # left_ventricle # hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy : comment = Great job man , the best is yet to come 👌🏻👌🏻👏👏# # شروع_کار ۱۴۰۱ ۱۴ ... ... # # # # پوشش_لوله # # رنگ_پودری # # # تولید_کننده # # # # # # # . \\u200c . ۲۴ # # See translation # SAP # # S4hana # # # # # Material_and_Resource_Planning # Capacity_Planning # Long_Term_Planning # Capacity_Requirement_Planning # Available_Capacity # # شروع_کار ۱۴۰۱ ۱۴ ... ... 🇮🇷: comment = ، .. .. ؛ # IT ؛ ، ، #، ؛ ؛: comment = ( ) 😅😅 AS ONE CHAPTER , ANOTHER …!

When a person have a ability to overcome poverty and misery , freedom from , it the quality of his life . Unforgivable , like the right to live , to be free and to pursue happiness , which are related to one \\' s identity , such as making daily about food , clothing , work and leisure time .

It may sound familiar when you think of your organizational culture . It goes like this : A researcher five in a cage . There ’ s a bunch of hanging from a string , with a ladder leading to the . When the first monkey goes for the , the researcher all five with freezing water for five . Sometime later , when a second monkey inevitably to go for the , the researcher once again all five with the cold water for five . The researcher then the hose away and never it again . But , when a third monkey to go for the , the other four attack him to prevent him from climbing that ladder . They are afraid of the punishment that may come . Then , the researcher one of the with a new monkey who ’ t part of the original experiment and was never with water . And as soon as he the ladder to go for the , the other four attack him to keep him from doing so . If he again , they attack him again . Thus , the new monkey not to go after the because he ’ get if he does . The researcher a second monkey with another new monkey . When this monkey goes for the , the other four attack him , the new monkey never with water . The researcher then to replace all the one at a time until all five original are removed from the cage . Each time the newcomer goes for the , the attack , even when they , as new , have never received punishment for going after the . And thus , the new , who have never been with cold water , learn not to go after the temptation of the . The hypothesize that if they ask the why they don ’ t go for the , they ’ d answer , “ because that ’ s the way it ’ s always been done .” That ’ s what we call the Five Monkey Experiment “ Syndrome .” oiler Up , Indy ! 🚂 President Mung , along with Board of Chair Mike and University President Whitten and Board of Chair , today officially University in .

Check it out on ( )\\' s page : :// . in / # # ’ m going to dive into an exciting topic zero - knowledge in - based cryptography . Zero - knowledge are cryptographic that enable us to prove the truth of a statement without revealing any additional information , and - based cryptography mathematical that allow us to perform on elliptic curve . Imagine you have a secret and someone to verify that you know this secret without you actually it . Zero - knowledge in - based cryptography provide a solution to this challenge . In - based cryptography , we use elliptic , which are mathematical , to perform on . These are used to construct zero - knowledge . Here \\' s a simplified analogy to help us understand the idea : Let \\' s say we have a magical door that can only be if we have two specific : a golden key and a silver key . However , we want to prove that we know the combination of these two without revealing the actual themselves . This is where - based zero - knowledge come in . 1 . Setup : We agree on the cryptographic and generate the necessary and elliptic . 2 . Interaction : You , as the verifier , possess the magical door and the golden key . I , as the prover , claim that I know the combination of the golden key and the silver key to open the door . However , I don \\' t want to reveal the actual . 3 . Proof : the operation , we can perform a series of that involve combining the golden key , the silver key , and other . These produce a proof that that I possess the knowledge of the combination without revealing the actual themselves . 4 . Verification : As the verifier , you can take the proof by me and use the operation to verify its validity . By the the given elliptic and public information , you can determine if the proof is valid without gaining any knowledge of the secret . The power of - based zero - knowledge in their ability to convince of a statement \\' s truth without revealing any sensitive information . By the operation on elliptic , we can perform that enable efficient and secure zero - knowledge . - based zero - knowledge have practical in like secure authentication , anonymous credential , and privacy - . They allow us to demonstrate knowledge of a statement without any private data , privacy and security in various digital . # security # cryptography # data # digital # mathematics # privacy # # - funded studentship ( Home or International ) with full stipend - on 3D Printing and , and in collaboration with .

We Expect the Fed to Cut Interest in 2023 We expect the Fed to pivot to easing monetary policy in 2023 as inflation back to the central bank \\' s 2 % target and the need to shore up economic growth becomes paramount . We project the federal - funds rate to fall from a peak 3 % at the start of 2023 to 1 . 5 % by 2024 . Accordingly , longer - term – mortgage – should fall as well . Falling inflation should clear the way for the Fed to cut interest . We \\' re projecting price to swing from inflationary to deflationary by 2023 , owing greatly to the unwinding of price by supply in , energy , and other . As such , we project inflation to average just 1 . 5 % over 2023 through 2026 . Once the war on inflation is won , the Fed could shift to doing what ’ s to jump - start economic growth . We ’ re projecting that real gross domestic product growth remains in positive territory on a full - year basis . But growth will be uncomfortably low in the near term ( we project 1 . 3 % in 2023 ), and that the Fed to easing . # economic # # 🚀 . . @ . net . @ . !!! 1 . : \" . \" \" The central limit theorem that the sampling distribution of the mean will always be normally distributed , as long as the sample size is large enough .\" 2 - - . . 3 - \\u200c . # مهندسی_صنایع # # مهندسی_مالی # # # Python Introductory Certificate .

I ’ m happy to share that I ’ m starting a new position as Product Manager at ! Every organization needs to innovate . But what type of innovation to give priority to ? This simple matrix with four of innovation may help . Innovation basically something new (‘ nova ’). This “ something new ” can be anything and that ’ s where the problem . In two ways . - First , by an overemphasis on product ( or service ) innovation , thereby not giving enough attention to other - Second , by getting by all the innovation that are out there . To solve both at the same time , it to gain some clarity on what of innovation there are . To that end , I ’ this simple 2x2 matrix what I think are the four most important of innovation for every organization . Let me first explain the two axes . The first is the inward - outward axis . Outward - are those that are mostly targeted at the market , at doing something new for . Inward - , on the other hand , are the organization itself . On the second axis , Operational are typically quite technical and tangible , and on the practical work and output . Strategic , on the other hand , regard how the organization is overall and how it value . This to the following four of innovation : 1 . Product Innovation . The most well - known type of innovation in which you change , improve or renew an organization ’ s and / or , or create new . 2 . Process Innovation . Often efficiency and quality - driven to improve the way the organization works on a day - to - day basis . This can concern any type of process . 3 . Business Model Innovation . A type , on how the organization and value . Often on new revenue . 4 . Management Innovation . Less commonly known but critical , this type how an organization is organized , , and led . Often decentralization . All four are important and with this matrix you can start your innovation portfolio . Ask yourself like : Do I have sufficient in all ? And , which type of innovation should get priority now ? # # # # ’ m happy to share that I ’ m starting a new position as Human Specialist at !
